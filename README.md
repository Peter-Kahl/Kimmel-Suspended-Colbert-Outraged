# Kimmel-Suspended-Colbert-Outraged
Applied case study extending Peter Kahl’s Authoritarianism and the Architecture of Obedience. Examines the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! under Trump’s second term as an instance of authoritarian epistemic capture. Reframes obedience as epistemic submission and explores fiduciary–epistemic scaffolds for resistance.
